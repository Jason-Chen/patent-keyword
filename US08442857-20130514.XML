<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A high performance capability assessment model helps a pulp and paper business meet the challenges of the global marketplace. As a result, the pulp and paper business can achieve the clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of core processes that reduce inefficiencies and waste that result from unnecessary process complexity and exceptions. In addition, the high performance capability assessment model helps the pulp and paper industry business to identify specific areas in which improvements may be made and understand how to make the improvements, and establishes levels of capability along the way to reaching an ultimate capability goal.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority from Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/164,618, entitled Pulp and Paper High Performance Capability Assessment, filed Mar. 30, 2009, and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure concerns a system and method to identify the performance of an organization on a scale of mastery across representative capabilities of the organization's industry. In particular, this disclosure relates to an efficient and cost effective way to assess the performance level of key capability areas within the processes of a pulp and paper industry organization.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modern pulp and paper industry organizations operate in an increasingly challenging environment. To survive, pulp and paper industry organizations must adapt to this environment and execute in a clear, consistent, and efficient manner. Furthermore, the regularity requirements and resource management challenges of pulp and paper businesses greatly increase the complexity and difficulty of surviving on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite the need for a pulp and paper organization to meet the challenges of the global marketplace, it is still often the case that the business lacks clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of its core processes. These shortcomings severely constrain the business, and lead directly to inefficiencies and waste due to unnecessary complexity, process exceptions, and customer dissatisfaction. At the same time, it can be very difficult to identify specific processes to which improvements may be made, either because the business itself does not have the expertise to identify the processes or because the complexities of the business frustrate attempts to clearly delineate the processes to be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Even if the pulp and paper business, on its own, could identify one of the many processes that it needs to improve, the business would not necessarily know how to improve the process or be able to identify a concrete and measurable improvement goal. Another difficulty exists in determining whether there are any intermediate goals that should be reached along the way. As pulp and paper businesses struggle to meet the demands of the modern economic landscape, they fail to identify opportunities for maximizing compliance and margin improvement, category expansion, multi-channel execution, selling performance, customer satisfaction improvement, and to reach other important goals.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a need exists for an efficient and effective system and method to assess the performance level of key assessment areas within the processes of an organization.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A high performance capability assessment (HPCA) model helps pulp and paper businesses meet the challenges of the global marketplace by defining a scale of performance mastery along which the current practices of the business may be located. The HPCA model accelerates the discovery of process and performance gaps within business operations. In addition, the HPCA model also helps the business to identify specific areas in which improvements may be made, how to make the improvements, and how to establish performance measures during the course of attempting to achieve an ultimate goal. As a result, the business can achieve the clarity, consistency, and well-defined execution of core processes that maximize the operating budget for optimum outcomes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The HPCA model includes a key factor dimension and a performance mastery scale dimension. The performance mastery scale dimension defines multiple mastery levels. The performance mastery levels form a scale of increasing organizational performance. The scale includes a &#x2018;Basic&#x2019; mastery level, an &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019; mastery level, and an &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; mastery level. Each performance mastery level includes criteria specific to a corresponding key assessment area. Each key assessment area identifies some aspect of a capability of a business.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A business capability can be defined as a bundle of closely integrated skills, knowledge, technologies, and cumulative learning that is exercised through a set of processes and that collectively represents an organization's ability to create value by producing outcomes and results. Capability area does not represent a delineation of organizational responsibilities as the business outcomes of a capability may be the result of a number of cross-functional teams. Capabilities of a business may be grouped into platforms. For example, the HPCA model groups the capabilities of the pulp and paper industry into ten high-level platforms, including a pulp fiber platform, a manage fiber supply platform, a produce rolls platform, a maintain production capability platform, a source and supply goods and services platform, a plan and manage supply chain network and inventory platform, a perform sales and operations planning platform, a provide production capability and operating services platform, a finish products platform, and a market and sell products platform. Examples of capabilities within the pulp fiber platform, for example, include prepare fiber, pulp and bleach, and dry and bale. Platforms may include sub-platforms, as well as capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The key factor dimension establishes a set of key assessment areas in which to analyze the capabilities of a business. Key assessment areas include performance capability criteria. Performance capability criteria populate the performance capability assessment model. The performance capability criteria may be specific to any one of many different business capabilities. For example, the manage fiber supply platform includes develop site, manage forest operation, and transport logs key assessment areas at each of the capability levels along the performance capability scale dimension. Any number of performance capability assessment models and performance capability criteria may be defined and stored in a capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and application to a business under examination. Accordingly, the HPCA model provides a flexible and adaptive scale of performance capability against which business practices may be compared to ascertain where the capabilities of a business under examination fall along the scale.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other systems, methods, features, and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. All such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages are included within this description, are within the scope of the invention, and are protected by the following claims.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a high performance capability assessment (HPCA) model <b>100</b>. The HPCA model <b>100</b> specifies ten high-level platforms, including a pulp fiber platform <b>102</b>, a manage fiber supply platform <b>104</b>, a produce rolls platform <b>106</b>, a maintain production capability platform <b>108</b>, a source and supply goods and services platform <b>110</b>, a plan and manage supply chain network and inventory platform <b>112</b>, a perform sales and operations planning platform <b>114</b>, a provide production capability and operating services platform <b>116</b>, a finish products platform <b>118</b>, and a market and sell products platform <b>120</b>. The HPCA model <b>100</b> is not limited to the form shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Instead, the HPCA model <b>100</b> may be adapted and modified to fill a wide variety of analysis roles. Additional, different, or fewer platforms may be used in other implementations, with each platform defining additional, different, or fewer capabilities. Each platform includes one or more multiple &#x3c;platform name&#x3e; capabilities <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The HPCA model <b>100</b> establishes a multidimensional pulp and paper industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance levels <b>138</b>, further described below in reference Tables 1-3. The performance levels <b>138</b> establish a scale of increasing effectiveness in delivery of each capability. The key assessment performance reference tables include a &#x2018;Basic&#x2019; <b>140</b> delivery level, an &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019; <b>142</b> delivery level and an &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; <b>144</b> delivery level. The performance levels establish a scale of mastery <b>146</b> along which current business practices may be located and identified with respect to any platform and capability within a platform according to an analysis of performance capability criteria (PCC). The capability under evaluation may be assigned the performance level <b>138</b> based on a delivery effectiveness position <b>158</b> along the scale of mastery <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The &#x2018;Basic&#x2019; delivery level <b>140</b> specifies &#x2018;Basic&#x2019; performance assessment criteria, the &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019; delivery level <b>142</b> specifies &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019; performance assessment criteria, and the &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; delivery level <b>144</b> specifies &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; performance assessment criteria. The HPCA model <b>100</b> receives input data that specifies a pulp and paper business platform (e.g., a pulp and paper industry area) and a pulp and paper industry key assessment area for analysis. The HPCA model <b>100</b> searches the multidimensional pulp and paper industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the pulp and paper industry platform and corresponding industry capability within the platform and the pulp and paper industry key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table. The HPCA model <b>100</b> initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance assessment level for the pulp and paper industry key assessment area.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The tables provided in the appendix listing immediately following the abstract, which form part of this disclosure, provide an explanation of the capabilities and corresponding key assessment areas and performance criteria for each capability within the respective platforms. Each capability may include one or more key assessment areas. Each key assessment area may include one or more additional key assessment areas. In other words, a business capability may include sub-capabilities, and therefore, key assessment areas corresponding to the multiple sub-capabilities. The tables in the appendix show specific criteria used to analyze each capability.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a multidimensional pulp and paper industry performance reference set <b>1200</b> (&#x201c;reference set <b>1200</b>&#x201d;) that provides a capability detail pool from which the system described below may obtain benchmarking tables for a pulp and paper business. The reference set <b>1200</b> includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables (&#x201c;reference tables&#x201d;), two of which are labeled <b>1202</b> and <b>1204</b>. Each reference table may provide the benchmarking criteria for a specific capability, such as those noted above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">One dimension of each table may establish the &#x2018;Basic&#x2019; performance level <b>140</b> specifying &#x2018;Basic&#x2019; performance assessment criteria, the &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019; performance level <b>142</b> specifying &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019; performance assessment criteria, and the &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; performance level <b>144</b> specifying &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; performance assessment criteria. Another dimension of each table may specify one or more key assessment areas (KAAs), several of which are labeled <b>1206</b>, <b>1208</b>, and <b>1210</b>. As noted above, performance criteria, e.g., the PCC <b>1212</b>, populates each key assessment performance reference table to provide benchmark criteria for &#x2018;Basic&#x2019;, &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The reference set <b>1200</b> represents the HPCA model <b>100</b>. Consistent with the HPCA model <b>100</b>, the reference set <b>1200</b> may organize multiple reference tables into a hierarchical structure defining discrete changes in granularity. In one implementation, the hierarchical structure includes reference tables, sub-platforms, platforms, and models. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> labels three sub-platforms <b>1214</b>, <b>1216</b>, and <b>1218</b>. The reference set <b>1200</b> may further organize the sub-platforms into platforms, two of which are labeled <b>1220</b> and <b>1222</b>. Platforms aggregate into the HPCA model <b>100</b> and corresponding reference set <b>1200</b>. Additional, different, or fewer levels of granularity may be defined in the HPCA model <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The reference set <b>1200</b> may dynamically populate the reference tables with the most up-to-date performance criteria, for example upon retrieval and presentation by a business analysis consultant. The performance criteria may be retrieved from a performance capability criteria database or other information source.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> also shows an example of a database implementation <b>1224</b> of a portion of a reference table. In particular, the database implementation <b>1224</b> includes records (e.g., the records <b>1226</b>, <b>1228</b>, <b>1230</b>) that establish each PCC <b>1212</b>. In the example shown, each record includes a PCC field <b>1232</b>, a category specifier field <b>1234</b>, and a KAA specifier field <b>1236</b>. Other fields may be provided, such as a reference table assignment field or reference set assignment field. The records categorize each PCC into a specific category (e.g., Basic), into a specific KAA, and, optionally, into a specific reference table in a specific reference set for any particular HPCA model.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a high-performance capability assessment system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) <b>1300</b>. The system <b>1300</b> includes a processor <b>1302</b> and a memory <b>1304</b>. Several databases support the operation of the system <b>1300</b>, including a performance capability database <b>1306</b>, a performance measured database <b>1308</b>, a capability detail pool database <b>1310</b>, and an assessment results database <b>1326</b>. The system <b>1300</b> may include a local display <b>1312</b> and input/output interfaces <b>1317</b> (e.g., including a keyboard, mouse, microphone, speakers, or other device), and, through the communication interface <b>1314</b> and networks <b>1316</b>, may communicate with remote devices <b>1318</b> and remote displays <b>1320</b>. The networks <b>1316</b> may be any combination of external networks (e.g., the Internet) and internal networks (e.g., corporate LANs). The displays <b>1312</b> and <b>1320</b> may, for example, present performance capability assessment models <b>1322</b> that the system <b>1300</b> retrieves from the capability detail pool database <b>1310</b> for review, modification, and application by process engineers or other individuals. With regard to local access or access by the remote devices <b>1318</b>, the system <b>1300</b> may include a login processing program <b>1324</b> to authenticate and/or authorize access to the system <b>1300</b>. To that end, the login processing program <b>1324</b> may include username/password verification, private/public key encryption, or other validation and data protection capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one implementation, the capability performance database <b>1306</b> stores performance criteria. As will be described in more detail below, the system <b>1300</b> may populate performance capability assessment models with performance capability criteria suited to any particular platform (e.g., pulp fiber <b>102</b>, manage fiber supply <b>104</b>, produce rolls <b>106</b>, etc.) and business capability at one or more capability levels across one or more key assessment areas. The performance measured database <b>1308</b> may store the determined, measured, or otherwise ascertained characteristics, criteria, and other measured data of a particular key assessment area as representative practice data <b>1348</b>. The representative practice data <b>1348</b> may be obtained through interviews with business consultants and industrial engineers, through online questionnaires, through manual or automated analysis of business data (e.g., year end operating reports), or in other manners. The capability detail pool database <b>1310</b> stores the capability detail pool <b>1200</b>, which includes pre-defined performance capability assessment models <b>1322</b>. The assessment results database <b>1326</b> stores determined capability levels for specific capabilities that have been analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The system <b>1300</b> facilitates the review, modification, creation, and application of performance capability assessment models. In that role, performance capability assessment model manipulation logic (&#x201c;manipulation logic&#x201d;) <b>1346</b> within the system <b>1300</b> creates, retrieves, and stores capability assessment data <b>1328</b> in the memory <b>1304</b>. The manipulation logic <b>1346</b> may establish capability assessment data <b>1328</b> in the memory <b>1304</b>, including a capability assessment data structure <b>1330</b> with multiple capability levels (&#x201c;CL&#x201d;) <b>1332</b> organized along a scale of mastery dimension, multiple key assessment areas (&#x201c;KAA&#x201d;) <b>1334</b> organized along a key factor dimension, and performance criteria (&#x201c;PCC&#x201d;) <b>1336</b> that populates the performance capability assessment model <b>1330</b>. The manipulation logic <b>1346</b> may vary widely in implementation, and, as one example, may include data storage logic <b>1352</b> that saves data in memory and user interface logic that accepts capability level specifications, key assessment area specifications and performance capability criteria inputs to create new performance capability assessment models, modify existing performance capability assessment models, delete performance capability assessment models, or retrieve performance capability assessment models for review.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one implementation, the manipulation logic <b>1346</b> establishes the capability assessment data structure <b>1330</b> to include a multidimensional pulp and paper industry performance reference set that includes multiple key assessment performance reference tables in which the key assessment performance reference tables include a &#x2018;Basic&#x2019; capability performance level, an &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019; capability performance level, and an &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; capability performance level.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The capability assessment data <b>1328</b> may also include a capability position specifier <b>1338</b>. The capability position specifier <b>1338</b> may record the capability level along the scale of mastery <b>146</b>, as determined for any particular capability. Thus, the system <b>1300</b> may store the performance level in the assessment results database <b>1326</b> or elsewhere for future retrieval and review.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one implementation, the data population logic <b>1340</b> may be a data population program executed by the processor <b>1302</b> that populates template performance capability assessment models. For example, the data population logic <b>1340</b> may include input logic <b>1350</b> that accepts input specifying a capability of interest that indicates a particular performance capability assessment model. The data population logic <b>1340</b> may include query logic <b>1345</b> that executes database queries and prompts a user for input to obtain the corresponding performance capability criteria for the capability of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In another implementation, for example, the query logic <b>1345</b> may receive an input specifying a pulp and paper industry area and a pulp and paper industry key assessment area with the pulp and paper industry area for analysis. The query logic <b>1345</b> searches the multidimensional pulp and paper industry performance reference set for a matching key assessment performance reference table that matches the pulp and paper industry area and the pulp and paper industry key assessment area, and retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The data population logic <b>1340</b> may further include storage logic that adds the retrieved performance capability criteria to the template performance capability assessment model. The data population logic <b>1340</b> produces populated performance capability assessment structures <b>1342</b> that may be stored in the capability detail pool database <b>1310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition to the analysis process described above, the system <b>1300</b> may provide an automated analysis of representative practice data <b>1348</b> that identifies relevant performance capability criteria and determines the position on the scale of mastery <b>146</b> of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria for the representative practice data <b>1348</b>. As one example, the system <b>1300</b> may implement capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> that includes comparison and/or matching logic that analyzes the representative practice data <b>1348</b> with respect to performance capability criteria to locate key assessment areas for which the system <b>1300</b> can determine capability levels to obtain a resultant performance level for each key assessment area.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may determine an overall position on the scale of mastery <b>146</b> as the capability position specifier <b>1338</b>, for a capability under examination given the knowledge of where the key assessment areas corresponding to the capability under examination fall in each capability level. Thus, for example, the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may determine an overall capability level for a capability corresponding to the capability level for the majority of the key assessment areas, or it may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the scale of mastery <b>146</b> for a capability. As another example, the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may implement an expert system (e.g., based on a neural network trained on prior determinations) that analyzes the determined characteristics with respect to the performance capability criteria and ascertains where the capability under examination falls along the scale of mastery <b>146</b> for each of the key assessment areas, or overall on the scale of mastery.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a flow diagram <b>1400</b> for creating performance capability assessment models. The performance capability assessment model creator (e.g., the manipulation logic <b>1346</b>) establishes a key factor dimension for the performance capability assessment model (<b>1402</b>). The performance capability assessment model creator also establishes a capability scale dimension for the performance capability assessment model (<b>1404</b>). The capability scale dimension may define a scale of increasing organizational capability. For example, the structure creator may create the &#x2018;Basic&#x2019; level <b>140</b>, the &#x2018;Intermediate&#x2019; level <b>142</b>, and the &#x2018;Advanced&#x2019; level <b>144</b>. The performance capability assessment model creator also populates the performance capability assessment model with capability performance criteria (<b>1406</b>). A capability detail pool <b>1200</b> may be formed to hold multiple tailored key assessment performance reference tables (<b>1408</b>). The performance capability assessment model creator may store the populated assessment structure in the capability detail pool for subsequent retrieval and analysis (<b>1410</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a flow diagram <b>1500</b> for retrieving and applying performance capability assessment models. A selection of a capability to be analyzed is obtained (<b>1502</b>). In one implementation, the system <b>1300</b> receives input data that specifies a pulp and paper industry area and a pulp and paper industry key assessment area for analysis. For example, the system <b>1300</b> may accept input from a business consultant that specifies a capability for analysis. The system <b>1300</b> may query the capability detail pool <b>1200</b> for a corresponding performance capability assessment model (<b>1504</b>). The corresponding performance capability assessment model may be pre-defined in the capability detail pool <b>1200</b>, or the data population logic <b>1340</b> (or other actor) may populate a performance capability assessment model template that the system <b>1300</b> newly creates, or that the system <b>1300</b> retrieves from a data store, such as the capability detail pool database <b>1310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another example, the system <b>1300</b> searches the multidimensional pulp and paper industry performance reference set in the capability detail pool <b>1200</b> for a matching key assessment performance reference table based on the input data that specifies a pulp and paper industry platform and a pulp and paper industry key assessment area. The system <b>1300</b> retrieves the matching key assessment performance reference table and initiates analysis of the matching key assessment performance reference table to obtain a resultant performance level for the pulp and paper industry key assessment area.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The system <b>1300</b> obtains representative practice data <b>1348</b> for the capability under examination in the specific business under review (<b>1506</b>). For example, a business consultant may interview the business to determine how the business currently executes the capability under review. As another example, a representative from the business may complete a questionnaire, submit business data for analysis and parameter extraction, or otherwise provide the characteristics of their current capability execution. As a further example, the system <b>1300</b> may retrieve the representative practice data <b>1348</b> from a database of previously obtained representative practice data.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The system <b>1300</b> compares the representative practice data <b>1348</b> to the performance criteria in the performance capability assessment model (<b>1508</b>). For example, a business consultant may use his or her expertise to arrive at a determination of level for the business and the capability under examination (<b>1510</b>). Alternatively or additionally, the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may perform an automated analysis of the assessment results data in the assessment results database <b>1326</b> and ascertain the performance level on the scale of mastery <b>146</b>. The system <b>1300</b> may store the assessment results, including the determined performance level, for future reference in the assessment results database <b>1326</b> or other location (<b>1512</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a flow diagram <b>1600</b> for analyzing representative practice data <b>1348</b> to determine a pulp and paper industry and a pulp and paper key assessment area to which the representative practice data applies. The system <b>1300</b> receives representative practice data <b>1348</b> as input data (<b>1602</b>). The system <b>1300</b> may receive the representative practice data <b>1348</b> from a database query performed by the query logic <b>1345</b> that the query logic executes periodically, when instructed by an operator, and/or automatically against any number of available database sources that store representative practice data <b>1348</b>. The capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> analyzes the representative practice data <b>1348</b> to identify performance capability criteria in the capability detail pool <b>1200</b> that the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> determines relevant to the representative practice data <b>1348</b> (<b>1604</b>). For example, the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may compare and/or match the content of the representative practice data <b>1348</b> with the performance capability criteria using natural language processing (NLP), text string and/or substring matching, by comparing tags linked to the representative practice data <b>1348</b> and that specify that any portion of the representative practice data <b>1348</b> is applicable to a specific PCC, by querying for a manual classification of the representative practice data <b>1348</b> to a PCC, or other matching technique. The capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may score and/or weight a performance capability criteria and compare the score and/or weight to a user specified relevance threshold to rank the relevance of the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data <b>1348</b> (<b>1606</b>). The user may specify particular terms and/or phrases to search and match between the performance capability criteria and the representative practice data <b>1348</b>, in order to score the performance capability criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may determine, based on the number of performance capability criteria that meet or exceed the relevance threshold, that the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> has identified a sufficient number of performance capability criteria for a specific key assessment area in order to determine a performance level for the capability as a whole or any key assessment area within the capability (<b>1608</b>). As one example, where at least 51% of the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area meet or exceed the relevance threshold, the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data <b>1348</b>. In another example, the performance capability criteria for a particular key assessment area may be ranked in importance and/or designated as mandatory in order to assess the key assessment area. In the event the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> identifies the mandatory performance capability criteria for a key assessment area, the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> applies the performance capability criteria to the representative practice data <b>1348</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may apply the performance capability criteria meeting or exceeding the relevance threshold to the representative practice data <b>1348</b> to determine whether any particular PCC is met. Accordingly, as the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> analyzes the PCC, the system <b>1300</b> tracks the best fit of the representative practice data <b>1348</b> to the PCCs in the key assessment performance reference tables. In other words, the system <b>1300</b> determines how the representative practice data <b>1348</b> meets (or does not meet) each PCC, thereby gaining insight into whether the representative practice data <b>1348</b> is indicative of Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced practices.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The system <b>1300</b> may also gauge the position on the scale of mastery <b>146</b> of each key assessment area corresponding to the performance capability criteria (<b>1610</b>). The capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may further determine an overall position on the scale of mastery <b>146</b> for a capability (<b>1612</b>). The capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may establish that a desired number and/or designated mandatory performance capability criteria for the key assessment areas have been identified as relevant to a capability and sufficient to determine the position on the scale of mastery <b>146</b> for the capability. For example, the capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may determine an overall performance level for the capability based on the performance level determined for the majority of the key assessment areas. The capability assessment logic <b>1344</b> may apply a weighted analysis technique to give more emphasis to some key assessment areas than others in determining the overall position on the scale of mastery <b>146</b> for the capability. Although selected aspects, features, or components of the implementations are depicted as being stored in computer-readable memories (e.g., as computer-executable instructions or performance capability assessment models), all or part of the systems and structures may be stored on, distributed across, or read from other computer-readable media. The computer-readable media may include, for example, secondary storage devices such as hard disks, floppy disks, and CD-ROMs; a signal, such as a signal received from a network or received at an antenna; or other forms of memory, including ROM or RAM, either currently known or later developed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Various implementations of the system <b>1300</b> may include additional or different components. A processor may be implemented as a microprocessor, a microcontroller, a DSP, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete logic, or a combination of other types of circuits or logic. Similarly, memories may be DRAM, SRAM, Flash or any other type of memory. The processing capability of the system may be distributed among multiple system components, such as among multiple processors and memories, optionally including multiple distributed processing systems. Parameters, databases, and other data structures may be separately stored and managed, may be incorporated into a single memory or database, may be logically and physically organized in many different ways, and may be implemented in many ways, including data structures such as linked lists, hash tables, or implicit storage mechanisms. Programs may be combined or split among multiple programs, or distributed across several memories and processors.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The HPCA <b>100</b> model provides unexpectedly good results for a performance capability assessment model, particularly in the pulp and paper industry. In particular, the combinations of key assessment areas and particular assessment criteria of the HPCA model, including the criteria noted in the Appendix of Tables, provide significant advantages over other assessment models. The unexpectedly good results include clearly identifying and delineating from among multiple related complex processes the specific processes to improve, how to improve said process, and identifying concrete and measurable improvement goals.</p>
